colabfit-tools
==============

:code:`colabfit-tools` is a package for constructing, manipulating, and
exploring datasets for data-driven interatomic potentials. This package is part
of the `ColabFit project <https://colabfit.openkim.org/>`_ at the University of
Minnesota.

Despite the rapidly increasing popularity of data-driven interatomic
potentials (DDIPs), training data for these models has historically been
difficult to obtain and work with. Data is often stored in internally-developed
formats, insufficiently documented, and not made readily available to the
public.

:code:`colabfit_tools` aims to address these problems by defining a standard
method for representing DDIP training datasets programatically, and providing
software tools for manipulating these representations.
