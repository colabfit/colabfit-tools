# colabfit-tools
Tools for constructing and manipulating datasets for fitting interatomic potentials

# Installation

Using `pip`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/colabfit/colabfit-tools.git@master
```

colabfit-tools is built to work with two back ends: Vast DB (as part of the NYU-HPC Data Lake) and PostGreSQL.  
  
The Vast DB version of colabfit-tools is built to manage the [ColabFit Exchange](www.colabfit.org)
  
Individual users should use the PostGreSQL version.  
Documentation for the PostGreSQL version will be forthcoming.
